Aircraft Flap Water Ingression Predictive Analytics Dataset - Synthetic Data Creation Note

Overview
This synthetic dataset replicates the structure and statistical properties of real-world aircraft flap inspection data, ensuring complete data anonymization for public sharing and educational purposes.

The synthetic data was engineered to match key statistical characteristics observed in the original dataset:
- Water ingression rate: ~34.8% (matching the proportion from real data)
- Disbond detection rate: ~94.6% reflecting typical component inspection findings
- Sample size: Preserved the original 503 inspection records
- Temporal span: 2316-day period (approximately 6.3 years) simulating long-term maintenance tracking

Realistic Business Patterns
Several domain-specific patterns were incorporated to ensure the synthetic data reflects realistic aircraft maintenance scenarios:
- Part Number Distribution: Varying inspection frequencies across PN01-PN13, with PN01 and PN02 representing high-usage components requiring frequent monitoring, while specialty parts (PN03, PN12) show minimal inspection activity
- Radiographic Parameters: mAm and SFD values follow industry-standard NDT practices, with film type selection (D4/D7) correlated to exposure requirements - high mAm values (>2) consistently paired with D4 film for optimal image quality
- Environmental Correlation: Rain season classification (NW Monsoon, SE Monsoon, Transition) based on Malaysian meteorological patterns, enabling seasonal water ingression analysis
- Inspection Clustering: Realistic daily inspection patterns with 1-5 inspections per day, weighted toward single daily inspections to reflect operational constraints
- Position Distribution: Left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) flap inspection balance (48%/52%) representing typical aircraft maintenance scheduling

Data Anonymization Features
- Temporal anonymization: "Relative Day" starting from 0 eliminates calendar-based operational intelligence
- Equipment coding: Generic PN designations mask actual part numbers and manufacturers
- Serial number abstraction: SN codes remove traceability to specific aircraft or operators
- Geographic anonymization: Seasonal patterns referenced to generic monsoon periods without location specificity
- Inspection ID masking: Sequential E-codes replace actual maintenance record identifiers

Technical NDT Parameters
The dataset incorporates authentic radiographic inspection variables:
- Exposure calculation: Physics-based formula (mAm/SFDÂ²) maintaining technical accuracy
- Film type correlation: Industry-standard D4/D7 selection based on exposure requirements
- Binning logic: Practical categorization of continuous variables for operational decision-making
- Quality indicators: Water ingression and disbond detection reflecting real composite structure failure modes

Data Security Note
The synthetic generation process ensures no reverse-engineering of original business intelligence, operational patterns, or proprietary maintenance procedures while maintaining analytical complexity suitable for data science practice and portfolio development in aerospace NDT applications.
